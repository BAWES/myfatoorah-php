## Installation

The preferred way to install this library is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```bash
$ composer require bawes/myfatoorah-php:dev-master
```
or add

```json
"bawes/myfatoorah-php" : "dev-master"
```

to the require section of your application's `composer.json` file.


## Usage

First we need to decide which environment we want to use

### Step 1: Initialize based on the environment

#### Test Environment
```php
<?php
use bawes/myfatoorah/MyFatoorah;

$my = MyFatoorah::test();
```

#### Live Environment
```php
<?php
use bawes/myfatoorah/MyFatoorah;

$merchantCode = "[Your merchant code here]";
$username = "[Your merchant username here]";
$password = "[Your merchant password here]";
$my = MyFatoorah::live($merchantCode, $username, $password);
```

### Step 2: Request a payment link and redirect to it
```php
<?php
use bawes/myfatoorah/MyFatoorah;

$merchantCode = "[Your merchant code here]";
$username = "[Your merchant username here]";
$password = "[Your merchant password here]";
$my = MyFatoorah::live($merchantCode, $username, $password);

$my->setPaymentMode(MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_ALL)
->setReturnUrl("https://google.com")
->setErrorReturnUrl("https://google.com")
->setCustomer("Khalid", "customer@email.com", "97738271")
->setReferenceId() //Pass unique order number or leave empty to use time()
->addProduct("iPhone", 5.350, 3)
->addProduct("Samsung", 12.000, 1)
->getPaymentLinkAndReference();

$paymentUrl = $my['paymentUrl'];
$myfatoorahRefId = $my['paymentRef']; //good idea to store this for later status checks

// Redirect to payment url
header("Location: $paymentUrl");
die();

```

### Step 3: Request Order Status for Payment status confirmation

Use `MyFatoorah::getOrderStatus($referenceId)` to get an update on the status of the payment.
This is best called after receiving a callback from MyFatoorah's returnUrl or errorReturnUrl.
You can also manually call this function after an interval if you store the reference id locally.

#### Sample Order Status Request
```php
<?php
use bawes/myfatoorah/MyFatoorah;

// Example Ref ID
$myfatoorahRefId = $_GET['id'];

// Order status on Test environment
$orderStatus = MyFatoorah::test()
    ->getOrderStatus($myfatoorahRefId);

// Order status on Live environment
$merchantCode = "[Your merchant code here]";
$username = "[Your merchant username here]";
$password = "[Your merchant password here]";
$orderStatus = MyFatoorah::live($merchantCode, $username, $password)
    ->getOrderStatus($myfatoorahRefId);
```

#### Order Status Response (Success)

```php
<?php
$orderStatus = [
    'responseCode' => '0', //MyFatoorah::REQUEST_SUCCESSFUL
    'responseMessage' => 'SUCCESS',
    'result' => 'CAPTURED',

    // Successful payment fields
    'payMode' => 'KNET',
    'orderId' => '1085183',
    'payTransactionId' => '673386261283050',
    'grossAmountPaid' => '32.500',
    'netAmountToBeDeposited' => '32.300',

    // User defined fields
    'udf1' => '',
    'udf2' => '',
    'udf3' => '',
    'udf4' => '',
    'udf5' => ''
]
```

#### Order Status Response (Failure)

```php
<?php
$orderStatus = [
    'responseCode' => '2009',
    'responseMessage' => 'Transaction Failed Messages',
    'result' => 'Payment Server detected an error',

    // User defined fields
    'udf1' => '',
    'udf2' => '',
    'udf3' => '',
    'udf4' => '',
    'udf5' => ''
]
```

## Payment Gateways

Configure the gateway you wish to use by passing GATEWAY constants available on the `MyFatoorah` class to `MyFatoorah::setPaymentMode`.

* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_ALL` - Generated link sends to MyFatoorah page with all payment methods
* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_KNET` - Generated link sends user directly to KNET portal
* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_VISA_MASTERCARD` - Generated link sends user directly to VISA/MASTER portal
* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_SAUDI_SADAD` - Generated link sends user directly to Sadad Saudi portal
* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_BAHRAIN_BENEFIT` - Generated link sends user directly to BENEFIT BAHRAIN portal
* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_QATAR_QPAY` - Generated link sends user directly to Qpay Qatar portal
* `MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_UAECC` - Generated link sends user directly to UAE debit cards portal


Usage Example:
```php
<?php
use bawes/myfatoorah/MyFatoorah;

$my = MyFatoorah::live($merchantCode, $username, $password);
$my->setPaymentMode(MyFatoorah::GATEWAY_ALL)
```
